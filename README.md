H-Bridge direct driver for mini solar lights for ATTiny85 

Drives LEDs at higher than standard frequency, with a subtle "breathing" effect.

Output via PWM timer 1 A/B - connect LED string directly across pins 3 and 7 (PB4 and PB1). Alternatively, use this to drive a MOSFET-based circuit for additional current or voltage.
